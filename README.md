## Installation

### Adding MCP to your python project

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python projects. 

If you haven't created a uv-managed project yet, create one:

   ```bash
   uv init mcp-server-demo
   cd mcp-server-demo
   ```

   Then add MCP to your project dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv add "mcp[cli]"
   ```

Alternatively, for projects using pip for dependencies:
```bash
pip install "mcp[cli]"
```

### Running the standalone MCP development tools

To run the mcp command with uv:

```bash
uv run mcp
```

# MCP Inspector

The MCP inspector is a developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers.

## Architecture Overview

The MCP Inspector consists of two main components that work together:

- **MCP Inspector Client (MCPI)**: A React-based web UI that provides an interactive interface for testing and debugging MCP servers
- **MCP Proxy (MCPP)**: A Node.js server that acts as a protocol bridge, connecting the web UI to MCP servers via various transport methods (stdio, SSE, streamable-http)

Note that the proxy is not a network proxy for intercepting traffic. Instead, it functions as both an MCP client (connecting to your MCP server) and an HTTP server (serving the web UI), enabling browser-based interaction with MCP servers that use different transport protocols.

## Running the Inspector

### Requirements

- Node.js: ^22.7.5

### Quick Start (UI mode)

To get up and running right away with the UI, just execute the following:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

The server will start up and the UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:6274`.

### From an MCP server repository

To inspect an MCP server implementation, there's no need to clone this repo. Instead, use `npx`. For example, if your server is built at `build/index.js`:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

For python server with `uv`:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run main.py
```
