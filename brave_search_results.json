Its aim is to help frontier models produce better, more relevant responses.\nAs AI assistants gain mainstream adoption, the industry has invested heavily in model capabilities, achieving rapid advances in reasoning and quality. Yet even the most sophisticated models are constrained by their isolation from data—trapped behind information silos and legacy systems. Every new data source requires its own custom implementation, making truly connected systems difficult to scale.\nMCP addresses this challenge. It provides a universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources, replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol. The result is a simpler, more reliable way to give AI systems access to the data they need.\nModel Context Protocol\nThe Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.\nToday, we're introducing three major components of the Model Context Protocol for developers:\nThe Model Context Protocol\nspecification and SDKs\nLocal MCP server support in the\nClaude Desktop apps\nAn\nopen-source repository\nof MCP servers\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet is adept at quickly building MCP server implementations, making it easy for organizations and individuals to rapidly connect their most important datasets with a range of AI-powered tools. To help developers start exploring, we’re sharing pre-built MCP servers for popular enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, Postgres, and Puppeteer.\nEarly adopters like Block and Apollo have integrated MCP into their systems, while development tools companies including Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph are working with MCP to enhance their platforms—enabling AI agents to better retrieve relevant information to further understand the context around a coding task and produce more nuanced and functional code with fewer attempts.\n\"At Block, open source is more than a development model—it’s the foundation of our work and a commitment to creating technology that drives meaningful change and serves as a public good for all,” said Dhanji R. Prasanna, Chief Technology Officer at Block. “Open technologies like the Model Context Protocol are the bridges that connect AI to real-world applications, ensuring innovation is accessible, transparent, and rooted in collaboration. We are excited to partner on a protocol and use it to build agentic systems, which remove the burden of the mechanical so people can focus on the creative.”\nInstead of maintaining separate connectors for each data source, developers can now build against a standard protocol. As the ecosystem matures, AI systems will maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets, replacing today's fragmented integrations with a more sustainable architecture.\nGetting started\nDevelopers can start building and testing MCP connectors today. All\nClaude.ai\nplans support connecting MCP servers to the Claude Desktop app.\nClaude for Work customers can begin testing MCP servers locally, connecting Claude to internal systems and datasets. We'll soon provide developer toolkits for deploying remote production MCP servers that can serve your entire Claude for Work organization.\nTo start building:\nInstall pre-built MCP servers through the\nClaude Desktop app\nFollow our\nquickstart guide\nto build your first MCP server\nContribute to our\nopen-source repositories\nof connectors and implementations\nAn open community\nWe’re committed to building MCP as a collaborative, open-source project and ecosystem, and we’re eager to hear your feedback. Whether you’re an AI tool developer, an enterprise looking to leverage existing data, or an early adopter exploring the frontier, we invite you to build the future of context-aware AI together.\nNews\nClaude Gov Models for U.S. National Security Customers\nJun 06, 2025\nNews\nReed Hastings appointed to Anthropic’s board of directors\nMay 28, 2025\nNews\nActivating AI Safety Level 3 Protections\nMay 22, 2025\nProduct\nClaude overview\nClaude Code\nClaude team plan\nClaude enterprise plan\nClaude education plan\nDownload Claude apps\nClaude.ai pricing plans\nClaude.ai login\nAPI Platform\nAPI overview\nDeveloper docs\nClaude in Amazon Bedrock\nClaude on Google Cloud's Vertex AI\nPricing\nConsole login\nResearch\nResearch overview\nEconomic Index\nClaude models\nClaude Opus 4\nClaude Sonnet 4\nClaude Haiku 3.5\nCommitments\nTransparency\nResponsible scaling policy\nSecurity and compliance\nSolutions\nAI agents\nCoding\nCustomer support\nLearn\nAnthropic Academy\nCustomer stories\nEngineering at Anthropic\nClaude Explains\nExplore\nAbout us\nBecome a partner\nCareers\nEvents\nNews\nStartups program\nHelp and security\nStatus\nAvailability\nSupport center\nTerms and policies\nPrivacy choices\nPrivacy policy\nResponsible disclosure policy\nTerms of service - consumer\nTerms of service - commercial\nUsage policy\n© 2025 Anthropic PBC",

Designed to standardize context exchange between\nAI assistants\nand software environments, MCP provides a model-agnostic universal interface for reading files, executing functions, and handling contextual prompts.\n[\n3\n]\nIt was officially announced and open-sourced by Anthropic in November 2024, with subsequent adoption by major AI providers including\nOpenAI\nand\nGoogle DeepMind\n.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n5\n]\nBackground\n[\nedit\n]\nThe\nneutrality\nof this section is\ndisputed\n.\nRelevant discussion may be found on the\ntalk page\n.

The protocol was released with\nsoftware development kits\n(SDK) in multiple\nprogramming languages\n, including\nPython\n,\nTypeScript\n,\nJava\n, and\nC#\n.\n[\n9\n]\nFeatures\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nis in\nlist\nformat but may read better as\nprose\n.\nYou can help by\nconverting this section\n, if appropriate.\nEditing help\nis available.\n(\nJune 2025\n)\nMCP defines a set of specifications for:\nData ingestion\nand\ntransformation\nContextual\nmetadata\ntagging\nModel interoperability across platforms\nSecure, two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered tools\n[\n7\n]\nThe protocol enables developers to either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.\n[\n7\n]\nKey components include:\nProtocol specification and SDKs\nLocal MCP server support in\nClaude\nDesktop apps\nOpen-source\nrepository\nof MCP servers\n[\n7\n]\nApplications\n[\nedit\n]\nThis section\nis in\nlist\nformat but may read better as\nprose\n.\nYou can help by\nconverting this section\n, if appropriate.\nEditing help\nis available.\n(\nJune 2025\n)\nMCP has been applied\n[\nwhen?\n]\n[\nby whom?\n]\nacross a range of use cases in\nsoftware development\n,\nbusiness process automation\n, and\nnatural language automation\n:\nSoftware development\n:\nIntegrated development environments\n(IDEs) such as\nZed\n, platforms like\nReplit\n, and code intelligence tools such as\nSourcegraph\nintegrated MCP to give coding assistants access to real-time code context, useful in\nvibe coding\n.\n[\n6\n]\nEnterprise assistants\n: Companies like\nBlock\nuse MCP to allow internal assistants to retrieve information from proprietary documents,\ncustomer relationship management\n(CRM) systems, and company\nknowledge bases\n.\n[\n7\n]\nNatural language data access\n: Applications like AI2SQL leverage MCP to connect models with\nSQL\ndatabases\n, enabling plain-language\ninformation retrieval\n.\nDesktop assistants\n: The Claude Desktop app runs local MCP servers to allow the assistant to read files or interact with\nsystem tools\nsecurely.\n[\n9\n]\nMulti-tool agents\n: MCP supports\nagentic AI\nworkflows involving multiple tools (e.g., document lookup + messaging\nAPIs\n), enabling\nchain-of-thought\nreasoning over\ndistributed resources\n.\nWeb application development\n:\nWix.com\nuses MCP servers within its website building platform to enable AI tools to access current website data and make live edits to websites.\n[\n10\n]\n[\n11\n]\nImplementation\n[\nedit\n]\nAnthropic maintains an open-source repository of reference MCP server implementations for popular enterprise systems including\nGoogle Drive\n,\nSlack\n,\nGitHub\n,\nGit\n,\nPostgres\n,\nPuppeteer\nand\nStripe\n.\n[\n12\n]\nDevelopers can create custom MCP servers to connect\nproprietary systems\nor specialized data sources to AI models.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe protocol's open standard allows organizations to build tailored connections while maintaining compatibility with the broader MCP ecosystem. AI models can then leverage these custom connections to provide\ndomain\nspecific assistance while respecting data access permissions.\n[\n7\n]\nAdoption\n[\nedit\n]\nIn March 2025,\nOpenAI\nofficially adopted the MCP, following a decision to integrate the standard across its products, including the\nChatGPT\ndesktop app, OpenAI's Agents SDK, and the Responses API. Altman described the adoption of MCP as a step toward standardizing AI tool connectivity. Prior to OpenAI's adoption, the potential benefits of MCP had been discussed extensively within the developer community, particularly for simplifying development in multi-model environments.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n3\n]\nBy adopting MCP, OpenAI joins other organizations such as Block, Replit, and\nSourcegraph\nin incorporating the protocol into their platforms. This wide adoption highlights MCP's potential to become a universal\nopen standard\nfor AI system connectivity and interoperability.\n[\n4\n]\nThe rapid growth and broad community adoption of MCP are demonstrated by Glama's publicly available MCP server directory, which lists over 5,000 active MCP servers as of May 2025.\n[\n13\n]\nMCP can be integrated with\nMicrosoft\nSemantic Kernel,\n[\n14\n]\nand\nAzure\nOpenAI.\n[\n15\n]\nMCP servers can be deployed to\nCloudflare\n.\n[\n16\n]\nDemis Hassabis\n, CEO of\nGoogle DeepMind\n, confirmed in April 2025 MCP support in the upcoming\nGemini\nmodels and related infrastructure, describing the protocol as \"rapidly becoming an open standard for the AI agentic era\".\n[\n5\n]\nMany MCP servers have since been added, allowing integration of LLMs with diverse applications.\n[\n17\n]\nReception\n[\nedit\n]\nThe Verge\nreported that MCP addresses a growing demand for AI agents that are contextually aware and capable of securely pulling from diverse sources.\n[\n6\n]\nThe protocol's rapid uptake by OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and toolmakers like Zed and Sourcegraph suggests growing consensus around its utility.\n[\n4\n]\n[\n18\n]\nIn April 2025, security researchers released analysis that there are multiple outstanding security issues with MCP, including\nprompt injection\n,\n[\n19\n]\ntool permissions where combining tools can exfiltrate files,\n[\n20\n]\nand lookalike tools can silently replace trusted ones.\n[\n21\n]\nIt has been likened to\nOpenAPI\n, a similar specification that aims to describe APIs.\n[\n22\n]\n[\n23\n]\nSee also\n[\nedit\n]\nAI governance\n– Guidelines and laws to regulate AI\nPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nApplication programming interface\n– Connection between computers or programs\nPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nLangChain\n– Language model application development framework\nMachine learning\n– Study of algorithms that improve automatically through experience\nSoftware agent\n– Computer program acting for a user\nNotes\n[\nedit\n]\n^\nDavid, Emilia (November 25, 2024).\n\"Anthropic releases Model Context Protocol to standardize AI-data integration\"\n.\nVentureBeat\n.
